# Transaction Tracker by J.B.

Having a new house is fun.

Buying that new house isn't.

Introducing a new kind of Real Estate software.  Designed by the agent, for the client.

If there's one area that technology has yet to revolutionize the Real Estate industry, it's making the escrow process more transparent and manageable for the client.

The Transaction Tracker by J.B. is a proof-of-concept visualization of an idea that's long been brewing in the head of its creator - a one-stop portal for both agents and home-buyers to keep track of deadlines, pending tasks, and other essential particulars of the month-long tornado of activity that is the escrow process.
